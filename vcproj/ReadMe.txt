    Win32 applications: tvpwin32 project overview
=================================================== ======================

This tvpwin32 application was created by AppWizard.

This file contains an overview of the contents of each of the files that make up the tvpwin32 application.


tvpwin32.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using the Application Wizard. Contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file and information about the platform, configuration, and project features selected in the application wizard.

tvpwin32.vcxproj.filters
    This is the VC++ project filter file generated by the Application Wizard. This file contains information about the associations between the files in your project and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to indicate a grouping of files with similar extensions on a particular node (for example, ".cpp" files are associated with "source file" filters).

tvpwin32.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

////////////////////////////////////////////////// ///////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

tvpwin32.rc
    This is a list of all Microsoft Windows resources used by the program. Includes icons, bitmaps, and cursors stored in the RES subdirectory. This file can be edited directly in Microsoft Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is a standard header file that defines a new resource ID. Read and update this file with Microsoft Visual C++.

tvpwin32.ico
    This is the icon file used as the application icon (32x32). This icon is included in the main resource file tvpwin32.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file that contains a small version (16x16) of the application's icons. This icon is included in the main resource file tvpwin32.rc.

////////////////////////////////////////////////// ///////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named tvpwin32.pch and a precompiled type file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate source code that you need to add or customize.
